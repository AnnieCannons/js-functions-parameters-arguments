# Using Paramters and Arguments in JavaScript

## Understanding function inputs

- Function inputs allow you to accept data or arguments from the outside world (i.e., the code that calls the function) and work with that data inside the function's body. This enables you to make the function more flexible and versatile, as it can perform different tasks based on the values passed as arguments.
  - Arguments are the values or expressions that you pass to the function when you call it. Functions can accept zero or more arguments, depending on how they are defined.
  - In JavaScript, a parameter in a function is a special variable that acts as a placeholder for values that are passed to the function when it is called. Parameters allow you to accept input and work with that input inside the function's code. They serve as a mechanism to pass values from the function call to the function's body.

 ```javascript
 function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // Function body - code that uses the parameters
}

functionName('value', 'value');
 ```
